// Implement Sieve of Eratosthenes

7.1
- Game 1: 1 shot
- Game 2: 2/3 shots
- When should you play G1 or G2?
- P(make shot) = p
- p = 3*p^2
-- (1/x) = 3 * (1/x)^3
-- 3 = x^2
-- x = 3^(1/2)
-- G1 and G2 are equal at p = 1/(3^(1/2))
-- G1 > G2 when p < 1/(3^(1/2))
-- G1 < G2 when p > 1/(3^(1/2))

7.2
- An ant has 2 directions to choose; it must choose one.
- A collision occurs when any ant is not moving in the same direction as all the other ants
- There are only 2 times when ants will not collide for all selections, there the probability of a collision is:
-- P(collision) = 1 - (1/(2^(N-1)); where N is the number of ants

7.3
- Given 2 lines in the Cartesian plane, they will not interesct if they have the same slope and are hence parallel.
- If the slopes are different they will eventually intersect.

7.4
- Implement {multiply, subtract, divide} using only add
- Multiplication of n by m is adding n to itself m times
- Subtract of m from n is adding the negative of m to n
- Division of n by m is subtracting m from n as many times as possible

7.5
- Find the line that intersects and halves two squares in two-dimensional plane
- Find the midpoints of each square, the line must pass through each midpoint, the slop then is
-- m_line = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)
-- y = m*x + b; b = y - (m_line * x)

7.6
- To find the line that passes through the most points we should find N^2 lines, then find all points that fit and take the line with the maximum fits.

7.7
- Find Kth number such that the only prime factors are 3, 5, 7.
- 3^a * 5^b * 7^c
-- find a, b, and c where a, b, c > 1
